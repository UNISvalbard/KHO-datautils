# Collection of small scripts for Nikon (DSLR) all-sky imagers at KHO

Note that most of these scripts have hardcoded directory names and structures. Additional error checking would probably be beneficial, too.

Also note that, while the filename conventions are strict, the "name" of the imager has changed due to unknown historical reasons. So, sometimes the imager is called (Nikon) "D80" and other times just "DSLR".

| Script | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| <samp>d80Thumbnail.py</samp> | Given a full filename of a raw image, create a 480x480 quicklook image with captions |
| <samp>dslrThumbnail.py</samp> | The same as above for "dslr" images |
